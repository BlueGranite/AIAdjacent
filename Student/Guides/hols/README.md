# Welcome to AI Adjacent.

This content is a seriouse of hands on labs designed to give you step-by-step instructions to implement artifical intelligence and machine learning in Azure and Power BI.  If you don't have much experience with these tools, don't worry the labs are designed to walk you through an appropriate progression of implementation.

Don't forget there are proctors around you, don't be afraid to ask questions if you get stuck.

- Estimated duration is ?? unknown, but will vary on format and on student skill level

## **Introduction**

Our solution begins with an existing data warehouse.  Adventure Works has a need to transition thier reporting to Power BI to better empower their business users to gain insights from their data without as much IT involvement in the reporting process. This endeavor begains as a fairly basic implementation of their data model in Power BI, but quickly devolves into a hybrid data architecture, and ultimately results in a variety of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning tasks to gain better insights from the data.  

## **Solution architecture**

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this hack. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.
