# Lab 3 - Working with Cognitive Services

## Prerequisities

1. [Lab 2 - Working with Data in Power BI](./02-Dataflows.md) should be done successfuly.


## Introduction

Adventure Works has been getting great business value out of the new model published in Power BI.  Now that users are gaining new insights into historical data they are asking for some advanced analytics features to get additional value and insights from the existing data.  Adventure Works analytics team quickly realized that they don't have the expertise to write artificial intelligence models.  They would like to leverage some native features of the cloud to apply AI to their existing data.  Presently they have a need to do the following:
*   Adventure Works sells products around the world, they have a need to discover the language used in a public review.
*   Some of the customers leave very verbose reviews, while getting positive feedback is always nice, Adventure Works is most concerned about negative feedback, they'd like to analyze the sentiment of a review to quickly find the negative reviews.
*   Since many of the reviews are very long, it would be great to extract some key details about the review from the larger text.
*   Optional:  Classify images in the products table.

The data warehouse team has the request to add reviews information to the data warehouse on their feature backlog, so you'll have to acquire the file from the team that runs Adventure Works website.  The team has been kind enough to extract the data for you as a delimited file in blob storage.
