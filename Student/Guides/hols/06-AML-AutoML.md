# Lab 6 - Building Machine Learning in Azure Machine Learning - AutoML

## Prerequisities

1. [Lab 5 - Building Machine Learning in Power BI - Designer](./04-AML-Designer.md) should be done successfuly.

## Introduction

Adventure Works marketing team loves the insights they've been getting from the Bike Buyer predictive model.  They love it so much, they'd like to apply it more broadly and use it from other systems.  Since the current model can only be used by Power BI, you've been asked to help Adventure Works recreate the model for use outside of Power BI.

## Steps

TODO
;;; since this is HOL maybe we give them the postman inferencing script so they don't have to figure that part out?  Again I would look at breaking this up into at least two modules (AutoML and Designer)
