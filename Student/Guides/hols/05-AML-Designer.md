# Lab 5 - Building Machine Learning in Azure Machine Learning - Designer

## Prerequisities

1. [Lab 4 - Building Machine Learning in Power BI](./04-PowerBIAutoML.md) should be done successfuly.

## Introduction

Adventure Works marketing team loves the insights they've been getting from the Bike Buyer predictive model.  They love it so much, they'd like to apply it more broadly and use it from other systems.  Since the current model can only be used by Power BI, you've been asked to help Adventure Works recreate the model for use outside of Power BI.

## Overview Steps

1. Open ml.azure.com
1. Create a datastore to the sql db
    1. Ensure you have access with your IP to the SQL Server
1. Create a dataset with the SQL View Pull
    1. Profile the data to understand it better
