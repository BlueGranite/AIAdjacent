# Welcome to AI Adjacent!

This content is a challenge based hack.  It's NOT step-by-step. Don't worry, you will do great whatever your level of experience! You will be guided through a series of tasks to implement an end to end solution by leveraging Power BI, Cognitive Services, and Azure ML.

Don't forget there are proctors around you, don't be afraid to ask questions if you get stuck.

## **Introduction**

Our solution begins with an existing data warehouse.  Adventure Works has a need to transition thier reporting to Power BI to better empower their business users to gain insights from their data without as much IT involvement in the reporting process. This endeavor begains as a fairly basic implementation of their data model in Power BI, but quickly devolves into a hybrid data architecture, and ultimately results in a variety of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning tasks to gain better insights from the data.  

## **Solution architecture**

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this hack. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.
