# Lab 2 - Working with Data in Power BI

## Prerequisities

1. [Lab 1 - Setup](./01-Setup.md) should be done successfuly.


## Introduction

Adventure works has been using a variety of reporting tools over the years, but is disillusioned with all of them.  Their CIO recently read a Gartner report on Power BI and is convinced they need to start doing all new report development on Power BI.  In order to prepare for the new report development, you've been tasked to setup a dataflow for some data in the warehouse for the purpose of building Power BI models.  Presently they have a need to represent the following data in the model:
*   Products
*   Customers
*   Sales
*   Fiscal Calendar

It is important to note that Adventure Works IT team had originally built their data warehouse on a "Snowflake" schema.  While this design works for the enterprise the structure of the model separating product catalog into three tables, and customer into two tables is a source of confusion for business users.  It is desired that the new model in Power BI should simplify this structure and endeavor to represent Customer as a single entity and Product as a single entity.
