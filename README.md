# Welcome to AI Adjacent!

This content is designed to take you, the business intelligence practicioner, and introduce you to a variety of concepts around artificial intelligence and machine learning.  We realize that there is a lot to becoming a data scientist, and upskilling in this area can be an intimidating tasks.  The goal of this Hackshop is to give you practical areas where you can gain value out of predictive technologies today.  

What is a "hackshop" you ask?  Well this is a phrase we coined to refer to a hybrid between a workshop and a hackfest.  Where a workshop implies a lot of presentations accompanied by some hands on labs, and a hackfest implies no presentations and an open ended solution with no instructions.  We strive to strike the ultimate balance between these two goals.  To acheive this we have a series of progressive challenges geared around the evolution of an analytics soluiton.  These challenges start with fairly straight forward reporitng problems but evolve into predictive analytics.

This hackshop will:
1. Offer presentations to introduce concepts.
1. Keep the volume of presentations light.
1. Provide a series of challenges to help you learn the concepts.  And build on the exercises in earlier challenges.
1. Provide you a rough outline to the appropriate order of activities to complete the challenge.

This hackshop will not:
1. Bore you to death with PowerPoint.
1. Run you through a set of mindless hands on labs were you can simply follow the steps and complete the exercises.

Don't forget there are proctors around you who are familiar with the content and the solutions, don't be afraid to ask questions if you get stuck.

- Estimated duration is unknown at this time, but we'd love to see how long it takes you so we can refine the content.

## **Introduction**

Our solution begins with an existing data warehouse.  Adventure Works has a need to transition their reporting to Power BI to better empower their business users to gain insights from their data without as much IT involvement in the reporting process. This endeavor begins as a fairly basic implementation of their data model in Power BI, but quickly devolves into a hybrid data architecture, and ultimately results in a variety of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning tasks to gain better insights from the data.  

## Technologies

In this hackshop, you will use a variety of Azure services and related products.  The primary products used are:
*   Azure Blob Storage
*   Azure SQL Database
*   Power BI Desktop, Embedded Capacity, etc.
*   Azure Machine Learning
